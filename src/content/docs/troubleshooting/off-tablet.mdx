What to do when the tablet on the wall is off.

## Turn it on
Normally pressing the power button will send the tablet to its lock screen. Most tablets do not have a password, though if it does, try 537900

## Open Chrome
If this takes the tablet to the app screen, you will need to open the Chrome browser. On most tablets, this can be found in the Google folder.

<Card title="Samsung browser" icon="warning">Do **not** use the default Samsung browser. Tablets are configured to keep their screen on only if Chrome is used, so if Samsung browser is in use the tablet will turn off again!</Card>

## Open the website
If the tablet does not have the website opened, navigate to `rooms.softwire.com`.

## Re-enable fullscreen mode
If the tablet ended its last session in fullscreen mode, it will provide a prompt asking to re-enable. If it does not, it's normally best to re-enable fullscreen mode using the burger menu.
